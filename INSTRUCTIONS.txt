1. Open the "Release" Folder;
2. To start the app, open "PathfindingSolutions.exe";
3. You will be prompted to insert the name of the file containing the maze (e.g. TestMazeA.txt). The files can be found in the "Release" Folder;
4. You will be prompted to select whether to use the Genetic Algorithm or the A* pathfinding Algorithm;
5. The result will appear in the console and in the "Main" SDL window.
6. To quit, close the console by clicking the red X button.

Note: if for whatever reason this does not work, open the solution in visual studio and run it from there (either release / debug mode).
